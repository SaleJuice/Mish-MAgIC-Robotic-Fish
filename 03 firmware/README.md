# Firmware

In this project, we use Arduino IDE to upload the firmware code to the main control board. For details about installation of Arduino IDE and configuration and upload of ESP32 boards, please refer to [Espressif Official Arduino-ESP32 Documents](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/arduino-esp32/en/latest/index.html).
